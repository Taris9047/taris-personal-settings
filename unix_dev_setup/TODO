>> Implement other platforms... namely Fedora, OS X
  --> Fedora would be pretty easy since the system's almost similar...
  --> OS X, we may not need do do too much. They have homebrew!
  --> Fedora and Manjaro may not need this kind of crap anyway. They provide state-of-art packages anyway. But then they aren't really optimized for current machine.
  ----> Thus, we may need some benchmarking session.
  --> Done with Cent OS and RHEL.

>> Some automatic update checking system? Many open source projects implement rss feed to notify newer versions.
 -> At least version checking has been implemented.

>> Some web-based system using rails. (far fetched)
