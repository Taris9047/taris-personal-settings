1. Implement other platforms... namely Fedora, OS X
  --> Fedora would be pretty easy since the system's almost similar...
  --> OS X, we may not need do do too much. They have homebrew!

2. Improve package information with more delecate format. Current text format is kinda lacking.

3. Think about implementing compiler options per package not a general option.

4. Some automatic update checking system? Many open source projects implement rss feed to notify newer versions.

5. Some web-based system using rails. (far fetched)
