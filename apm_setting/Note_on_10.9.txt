Note on 10.9 installation.

1. libcURL needs to be installed from the source.
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-shared
(Now we can use homebrew with this)

2. pixmap support has been dropped due to missing xpm.h 
(Fixed with XQuartz)

3. libiconv is also missing... Also, needs to be installed from source.
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
(hombres can handle this as well)

4. mcrypt can be installed from Homebrew.
