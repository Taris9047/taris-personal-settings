To fix NUMA node -1 error!

Actually, we are not really fixing the error.. it's just a walkaround.

According to some people's research in...

We can 'fool' the system by just correcting the system descriptor file of the GPU.

Therefore, we can just simply implement the crontab command as root to be triggered on each reboot.

for pcidev in $(lspci -D|grep 'VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA'|sed -e 's/[[:space:]].*//'); do echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/${pcidev}/numa_node; done

What a mess... nvidia-smi doesn't accept it either. Maybe we need to set up this NUMA node crap on the BIOS?
