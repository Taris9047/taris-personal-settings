Keyboard set up tips for Macbook Pro (Intel) for Linux Mint. The 2008 MacBook Pro was a bit hectic to use Linux Mint due to innate Apple Keyboard functionality difference to Windows PCs. But they can be edited for better integration.

1.) In your menu(mintMenu if you use Mint), select Keyboard. This will bring up the keyboard preferences.
2.) Go to the Layouts tab and click the Options button. This will now bring up a window with a list of options.
3.) Click on 'Alt/Win key behavior' and select 'Control is mapped to Win keys (and the usual Ctrl keys)'.
4.) Close that window, and in the Keyboard Preferences window, click 'Apply System-Wide'. Once you have done that, you can close Keyboard Preferences.
