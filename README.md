# My personal UNIX/Linux settings repository.

## Usage
Just run this line on your home directory. Hopefully, server admin is not a crazy person to omit ==curl== from installation.

```shell
curl -s 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Taris9047/taris-personal-settings/master/install_conf.sh' | /bin/bash
```

This will download this repository and make sure everything is laid out correctly. 

Fill up ==~/.gitconfig.local== to set up your main repository.
